Drawing from more than 400 reels of donated home movies from the era, other unearthed footage and newly recorded oral histories, the documentary is being produced by the Free Press in collaboration with Bridge Magazine and WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and a group of metro Detroit cultural institutions, led by the Detroit Institute of Arts.","genres":["Documentary"],"poster":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/6pqeV7jYz4JwoZsEByHzGFCmo3u.jpg","release_date":1490832000},
